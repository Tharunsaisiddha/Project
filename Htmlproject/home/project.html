                        <p>Thali is a combination of meals, consisting of two or more curries, steamed rice, poppadoms, pickle, naan or chapatti, buttermilk, raita and a sweet dish, all served on one plate.

                        <p>Originating from the state of Tamil Nadu, Idli Vada is a very common South Indian dish, so popular that it can be found everywhere, from high end restaurants to pushcart vendors.

Usually eaten for breakfast, Idli Vadas are both light in texture and filling.</p>

                        <h3>Chettinad:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Chettinad is the name given to a wide variety of dishes stemming from the Chettinad region, located in South India. This dish is traditionally presented on a banana leaf instead of a plate, with each food item having a specific place. Chettinad has a reputation for being quite fiery, but usually the dish is milder with perfectly balanced flavours. Some examples of Chettinad dishes include Chettinad Chicken and Karaikudi Eral Masala.
